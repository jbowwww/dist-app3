/* 180926 : dist-app3
 * Another re-write, where artefact types are each in their own table
 * This should hopefully avoid the difficulty and awkardness related to static member functions and data properties on embedded document schemas.
 * Simplicity will be a focus on this version, not just technically but conceptually..
 *	- No overall, all-encompassing, universal container "artefact" type to speak of - not like dist-app2
 *	- Any document model may reference another as required, whether its conceptually inheriting, containing, or referencing the referenced type,
 *	  but does so directly and explicitly in it's own terms
 *	- In such cases I think document IDs and mongoose populate() will be used, although not 100% decided here yet
